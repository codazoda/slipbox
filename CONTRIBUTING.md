# Contributing to Slipbox

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Please open an Issue first (not a Pull Request)

For this project, please **do not open a PR as the first step**.
Instead, open a GitHub Issue describing:

- the problem you are trying to solve,
- the behavior you expect,
- any constraints or tradeoffs,
- and (if useful) examples or mockups.

This helps us shape clear specifications before implementation.

## Why this workflow exists

Slipbox is also an experiment in **agentic coding**.

- It was translated from another project with AI assistance.
- Code in this repository is written by AI based on user specifications.
- GitHub Issues are a primary input channel for those specifications.

In short: ideas and requirements come from users, and AI generates implementation from that spec.

## What to include in a good Issue

A strong Issue usually includes:

- context (what you are trying to do),
- current behavior,
- desired behavior,
- acceptance criteria,
- edge cases,
- and any non-goals.

The clearer the Issue, the better the implementation quality.

## Security and sensitive changes

If your request touches authentication, permissions, data handling, or anything security-sensitive, call that out explicitly in the Issue.
