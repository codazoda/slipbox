# Contributing to Slipbox

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Keep it simple

These are **guidelines**, not red tape.

If you think you found an issue, please report it — no need to overthink it.
A short issue is totally fine.

## Preferred workflow: open an Issue first

We prefer starting with a GitHub Issue before opening a PR, because it helps us align on what should be built.

Helpful details (when you have them):

- what happened,
- what you expected,
- steps to reproduce,
- screenshots/examples,
- and any constraints.

But again: if all you have is “this seems broken,” that’s still useful.

## Why this workflow exists

Slipbox is also an experiment in **agentic coding**.

- It was translated from another project with AI assistance.
- Code in this repository is written by AI based on user specifications.
- GitHub Issues are a primary input channel for those specifications.

In short: users provide needs and specs, and AI generates implementations from those specs.

## Security and sensitive changes

If your report touches authentication, permissions, data handling, or anything security-sensitive, please mention that in the Issue.
